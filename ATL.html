  The Atlanta Hawks have a fairly continuous starting lineup, 
which is headlined by Trae Young and Kevin Huerter in the backcourt. 
On occasion, you might see Cam Reddish draw a start, but that is usually 
due to injury. The rookie, De'Andre Hunter was a top-five pick 
and is known for his play on the defensive side. The frontcourt got 
a new name with Clint Capela, who gives them their starting center for the future. 
Playing him next to John Collins is going to be tough for opposing teams. 
Collins is already one of the top young players in the league.
