  There is an overload of guards on the Cleveland Cavaliers and the rotations 
have been a bit tricky to narrow down. Darius Garland and Collin Sexton are
the two that start the most in the backcourt as they are the ones that were 
highly sought after in the draft for Cleveland. Cedi Osman starts at small forward, 
however Kevin Porter Jr is a name that could be the feature guy there soon. 
Kevin Love and Andre Drummond are the starting front court options, 
and the Drummond trade ended up pushing Tristan Thompson to the bench.
