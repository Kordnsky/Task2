  Injuries have ravished the Warriors roster leaving Stephen Curry and 
Klay Thompson on the shelf. Because of this the starting lineup looks 
a lot different. We have seen names like Damion Lee and Jordan Poole get more run, 
and Andrew Wiggins has moved into the starting lineup with the Warriors after 
being traded from the Timberwolves. Draymond Green and Marquese Chriss 
make up the front court, and after the season ends we should see the Warriors look 
a lot more normal.
