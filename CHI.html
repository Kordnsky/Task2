  Injuries continue to ravage the Chicago Bulls, 
but when healthy we see Kris Dunn operate as the starting point guard, 
however Zach LaVine is the main man on the offensive side. LaVine starts 
in various positions as he will be the starting shooting guard or Zach LaVine. 
Denzel Valentine has turned into a key piece for the Bulls with Otto Porter banged up. 
Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr make up the young front court for Chicago. 
Both are going to be key pieces moving forward in how this team develops. 
On occasion you will see Thaddeus Young draw starts when injuries occur.
