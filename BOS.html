  Boston's core has been similar over the last few years
with their young studs in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. 
The starting point guard role is now Kemba Walker's 
and that will be the case over the next few seasons. 
Gordon Hayward has found his form in Boston and gotten back to full health. 
This gives the Celtics a strong starting five. 
Daniel Theis has been the starting center more often than not, 
but on occasion, you might see Enes Kanter slip in there. 
The same goes for Marcus Smart when Brad Stevens wants to 
change the lineup up or an injury has occurred.
